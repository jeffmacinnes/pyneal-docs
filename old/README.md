# Pyneal Docs

*Currently in Development*

Documentation for [Pyneal](https://github.com/jeffmacinnes/pyneal)

This repository is markdown files and images only!

The markdown files in this repository are used to populate the much nicer looking [Pyneal Docs Website](https://jeffmacinnes.github.io/pyneal-docs-website). Of course, you're also welcome to read the markdown files on their own (or download for offline access).

## Editing content
By editing the files in this repository, you will also be editing the content of the [Pyneal Docs Website](https://jeffmacinnes.github.io/pyneal-docs-website). There are a couple of formatting tips to make sure that the content gets translated to the website appropriately.
