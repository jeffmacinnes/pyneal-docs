# Pyneal Docs

*Currently in Development*

Documentation for [Pyneal](https://github.com/jeffmacinnes/pyneal)

This repository is markdown files and images only!

The markdown files in this repository are used to populate the much nicer looking Pyneal Docs Website. Of course, you're also welcome to read the markdown files on their own (or download for offline access).
